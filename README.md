This is a solo project for the Project and Algorithms course at Coding Dojo. 

I wanted to take something in from my real life and make it a bit better. The idea is that of a to-do list at work, but is specific to the role that the worker is doing that day, according to the schedule.

There is a login and registration page. After the user registers or logs in they are landed at the homescreen where they are directed to choose the corresponding role that they are working in based on the 
schedule for that day. Once they click on the role it takes them to the specific page for that role which includes a description of the role, and has a task list that can be added to. There is functionality to
view and edit the task, including a description or notes. You can delete the tasks right off of the page. When the user clicks on the checkbox, the data gets a line through as well as the checkmark. On the 
left hand side of the page, there are some suggested tasks for the role, in which you can also click on and add them to the task list automatically. 

The database has 2 schemas, one for the users to register and login, and one for the task lists. Validations are set. The display is a work in progress though. 

I used Tailwind CSS for the first time on this project. I enjoyed using it and look forward to learning and using it more in refactoring of this project as well as future projects.
